Imaging that you have been hired by this firm to help them summarize and understand how good their employees are in terms of their sales. You’ll write up a report for the company (so they are your audience when writing). Your report will be in the form of an .html notebook."

Please note that the employees have different roles so not everyone is entirely focused on sales.
